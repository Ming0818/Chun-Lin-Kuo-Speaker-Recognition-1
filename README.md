# Variational Bayesian GAN for Speaker-Recognition
There are a total of 4958 speakers in the dataset of NIST i-vector machine learning challenge. We counted the number of samples of each speaker that is less than n in the dataset where n range from 2 to 10. The table 6.3 shows the result. We can find out there is one fifth of speakers with one sample. The dataset is unbalanced.

In this experiment, if the number of sample of each speaker is less than n, we will supplement the number of sample of each speakers to n where n range from 2 to 5. The table 6.4 show the evaluation On PLDA with different dimension of latent variable after performing data augmentation. We find that the performance of PLDA has improved after performing data augmentation. VBGAN provides the greatest improvement to PLDA. There is a strange phenomenon when the added sample increase, the VBGAN can not provide the improvement for PLDA. It may the data augmentation model produces the data which are too similar, so that the model is too consistent with some feature of speaker. Therefore, how to measure the generated sample is a problem.
